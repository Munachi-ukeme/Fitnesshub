FitnessHub is a one‑page fitness website prototype built entirely with HTML and CSS. It was designed to showcase a modern landing page for a fitness brand, featured products, Shop by Category, Helpful Contents and Customer Favourites.

FitnessHub was created as a beginner project to practice front‑end development.
It demonstrates how a single page can effectively present a brand’s identity, services, and call‑to‑action using only HTML and CSS.
